# openai-codex
IA chat with openai API


This project is a web application for Artificial Intelligence (AI) using OpenAI's GPT-3 API. GPT-3 is a powerful language model that can generate human-like text from a small amount of input.

The web application will allow users to interact with GPT-3 via a text interface. The user will be able to input a sentence and the GPT-3 model will generate a response. The user will also be able to filter the results by different categories and topics.

The project is powered by JavaScript and Node.js. It also uses the OpenAI API, Express and the Vite JS.

It will also provide an easy way for people to explore and interact with GPT-3.
